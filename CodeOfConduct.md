# Learning from Incidents in Software - Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

The goal of this community is to provide an avenue to advance the understanding and adoption of learning from incidents and resilience engineering techniques in the
software industry.

We as members and admins pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, political affiliation, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, psychologically safe, and healthy community with our goal in mind. We pledge to remember this is a ​ professional setting ​and to act as we would in a work environment.

## Our Standards

Keep the community ​ on topic ​. While many avenues are valuable to advancing the software industry, this particular slack is about ​ learning ​ from incidents. Please keep all topics and conversations related to that in some way (even if it is discussing cases from other industries, though please handle those with care). If necessary, use the :stayontarget: reacji to remind participants to stay on topic.

This is an intentionally small, private community, with sponsored membership. Members were invited because we value your participation and recognize you have an interest in these fields and see value in including them in the software industry. We seek to get to know each other well and build lasting relationships.

If you are new to the space, spend a week or so orienting yourself and observing conversations — the admin who invited you will reach out to you to help ease you into
the space/conversations during your first week. Know the focuses of the space — read through the fields this community is building from (Human Factors/Systems Safety, Resilience Engineering, Cognitive Systems Engineering) to avoid misunderstandings and arguments. (there is a dedicated reading list in the community README).

**#questions** ​ is there to ask any and every kind of question related to these spaces, it is meant to be beginner-friendly.

**Have a learning attitude** ​— if you see a conversation drifting into being polarizing, help guide the conversation. Ask questions before you get combative — and seek to understand before you make assumptions. Assume good faith and intention from your fellow community members. If someone else is not following this, use the :red_circle: emoji and alert an admin. Most of the topics in this Slack are newer to the software industry. As a result, misunderstandings will naturally arise and that’s ok, as long as there is a commitment to repair misunderstandings proactively and maturely as they arise.

**Be aware of your volume** ​ - High-volume users, even well intentioned ones, have the effect of discouraging others from participating in conversations. If you are involved in every conversation and sending almost 100 messages in one day, chances are you aren’t leaving a lot of space for others to participate. Alternate between observing and participating and be mindful that your presence may lead to not hearing from other voices.

**Please spend at least a month in the community before requesting invites for other members.** ​All community members that do bring someone in to the workspace will be asked to sponsor that person during their time in the community. If a member has been put on recent notice or warning by an admin because of previous behavior or complaints, they may not be able to request invites.

**Trolling, attention-stealing behavior, or harassment of any kind is not tolerated** ​. If you are noticed trolling, you will receive one warning, if you are told again, you will be asked to exit the workspace for a short amount of time, possibly indefinitely. If an admin notices that a message is harmful to the community, they will either remove it or ask you to remove it. ​ _More details on this in below sections._

This workspace is invite-only, ​Chatham House rules​ apply, and is ​ **not** ​anonymous. This means no taking screenshots or posting outside of the Slack (unless you have a member’s permission). As such, we ask you to add a ​ **human name** ​(what you go by) and a ​ **picture of yourself** ​so that we can build trust with each other. If for some reason your safety is at risk by the removal of anonymity, please talk to one or more admins to discuss. While we will be inviting new members, they will be invited in via slow trickle and will be vetted through one of the admins. We seek to ensure that the number of ​ learners ​ don't outweigh the number ​ teachers ​. While we are all learners and teachers, folks coming in having not read up much on research around incidents, practice around learning from incidents, or practice around facilitating incidents will take up a lot of the energy in the chat rooms and could throw it off balance and burn-out the teachers. ​ If you find yourself talking at length on a
topic (regardless of whether you have expertise on it), ​it’s good to pause for a bit and give others the opportunity to talk.

@here and @channel are only enabled for admins and will just be used for important announcements in the #announcements channel.

**No commercial marketing**
The LFI Slack is meant as a place to discuss ideas, not showcase your product. Links to personal blogs or talks are typically ok, but commercial activity is not tolerated, except in channels dedicated to this purpose ​(e.g. #opportunities (job postings), #conferences, or #services). If you are just here to sell things/advertise and not contribute and learn, the community will notice quickly and you may be asked to give your spot to another member.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community admins are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Community admins have the right and responsibility to remove messages and other contributions that are judged by the admins to not be aligned to this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include chatting about it in public spaces, posting via an official blog, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community admins responsible for enforcement at admin@learningfromincidents.io​, ​via a private DM, or a post in #lfi-admin-retro​. ​All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community admins are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
