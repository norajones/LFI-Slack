# Learning From Incidents in Software Slack Community
Documents and resources for the "Learning from Incidents in Software" slack workspace.

We're at an age in software where learning from incidents is pivotal to our success, and we don't get exposed to this as much as we should while we're being trained. Combined with a tremendous collection of impenetrable literature, leadership exists as an essential learnable skill that is often learned on the job. This slack exists to help longtime, new, and aspiring software engineers and software engineering leaders to learn human factors, systems safety, and distilling information within their organizations through conversation and sharing of ideas.

If you are looking for more information on these fields, Lorin Hochstein has put together a nice aggregation of info here: https://github.com/lorin/resilience-engineering

Once you’re in the workspace, the following suggestions and guidelines are intended to make your first days of the community more useful and educational:

1. Go and introduce yourself on #intros. Tell us about yourself, give a fun fact, update your profile with a photo. Put the "human" in human factors.
2. Read the Code of Conduct.
3. Explore the channels. There are a lot of them and, chances are, there is already a rich conversation in progress on your favorite leadership topic. If you’re looking for a place to start, we recommend:
   * #cases (share your favorite and interesting public incidents)
   * #conferences
   * #human-factors
   * There are also regional meetup channels for New York (#new-york) and San Francisco (#bayarea), feel free to create one for your region if you don't see it on the list.
   * Our channels will have people from all over the world, please check out the channel population before using @here or @channel.
   * If your favorite topic isn’t being discussed, create it. Channels are free. Announce your newly created channel on #new-channels.
4. Everyone is welcome to contribute regardless of where you are in implementation, studies, or research. If you want to hang back and lurk, that’s cool.
5. We expect that we’ll treat others with respect. We encourage debate; we ask for patience, and we remind you that you’re here to learn and that means being open to a diverse set of ideas.
6. This Slack is not a place for commercial activity (e.g. recruiting, or marketing your product/conference) except in channels dedicated to that purpose (e.g. #conferences, or #services) and never in an unsolicited direct message. If you are just here to sell things and not contribute and learn, the community will notice quickly. If you see commercial behavior going down, direct message any of the admins, and they will fix it.

If you know someone who should be in here, drop @nora, @lorin, or @Will Gallego (the admins) a direct message in the Slack, and one of them will send an invite.

We are a small and new community right now, but we expect this to evolve and grow over time, as such, so will these guidelines.

Happy learning!
